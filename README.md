# request-info

> a GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that requests more info from newly opened PRs/Issues that contain either the default title or whose description is left blank. It does so by taking data from a file in your repository. It should be located in a `.github/request-info.md`

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this plugin.
